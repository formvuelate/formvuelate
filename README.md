Visit [FormVueLate 3.0's full documentation](https://formvuelate.js.org/#getting-started) for more detailed information and examples.

## Getting Started

FormVueLate is a zero dependency library that allows you to generate schema-driven forms with extreme ease.

The schema that you use for your form can be as flexible as you need it to be, it can be modified at run-time with an expected reactive result, and can even be fetched directly from you backend’s API.

**Important**

FormVueLate is a bring-your-own-components library!

We do _not_ provide any base components for your to build your forms. There are numerous component libraries out there that do a great job of providing carefully constructed components for you to use, and FormVueLate does a great job at allowing you to bring those external components to your forms, or even crafting your own.

### FormVueLate 2.x

The docs for FormVueLate 2.x can be found [here](https://formvuelate-2x.netlify.app/)

## Installation

To add FormVueLate to your project, start by installing the package through your favorite package manager.

```bash
yarn add formvuelate
// OR
npm install formvuelate
```

## Using the SchemaForm component

Now that you have the package in your project, `import` it to your component.

```javascript
import { SchemaForm, useSchemaForm } from 'formvuelate'
```

The `SchemaForm` requires one `prop`, `schema`, which is the meta-data of your form. You must also import the `useSchemaForm` composable which we will use in our setup function to initialize the form's `model` where the user's data is kept.

```html
<template>
  <SchemaForm :schema="mySchema" />
</template>

<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { SchemaForm, useSchemaForm } from 'formvuelate'

export default {
  components: { SchemaForm },
  setup () {
    const formModel = ref({})
    useSchemaForm(formModel)

    const mySchema = ref({
      // Schema here
    })

    return {
      mySchema
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

`SchemaForm` will automatically update the state within your `formModel` when your components update.
